Overview:

Implement a Abstract Data Type called a Matrix, which acts similarly to
that of a two dimensional array with the addition of methods that allow
the user/a person to alter areas inside the Matrix such as removing parts of the
Matrix, changing the contents located in a certain area in the Matrix, etc.
